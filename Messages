Hi guys! I am available Monday and Wednesday after class 12:15PM or whenever it ends and I believe that's pretty much it. 
Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday I work, so it is sort of hard to meet up unless we can just break it down on here to see
who's doing what or how we want to divide the workload.

  We will need to:
  1. determine an algorithm
    I will get this posted soon.
  2. Write a program that implements the algorithm in PHP and HTML
    a. make a web form
      i. input text area for plaintext to be encrypted or ciphertext to be decrypted
      ii. display text area to output encrypted or decrypted text
      iii. Button to hash
      iv. button to encrypt
      v. button to decrypt
    b. add hashing functionality
      i. probably using sha2()
    c. add encryption functionality
      i. we will have to figure out how to implement the algorithm in php
    d. add decryption functionality
      i. we will have to figure out how to reverse the algorithm in php
    e. debug
  3. Style the program using CSS
  
  I believe that is all. 
  Do we want to allow a user to input a key? 
  Do we want to have one page which can manipulate the input in any of three ways, or have an index with links to 
   three separate pages, 1 each for hashing, encryption, and decryption?
  A text input box to either type or cut and paste into will probably be the easiest; do we want to try to have a file
    input also or instead?
